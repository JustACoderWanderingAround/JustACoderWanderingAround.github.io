            <h2>What are trains?</h2>
            <p>Trains are a series of connected vehicles (often called carriages or wagons) connected together that run
                along a railway track. They are generally used for the carriage of people and cargo across long
                distances.</p>

                        <h3>General characteristics</h3>
                        <p>Freight refers to any goods or cargo transported by a vehicle.<br>
                            The transport of goods (coal in particular) was the main reason why trains were even
                            invented at all. <br>
                            Trains allow for the efficient transport of a huge amount of goods from one place or
                            another.
                            Freight trains are generally made up of separated locomotives hauling unpowered
                            purpose-built wagons so that the railway company has flexibility in allowing certain
                            segments of the train to go to different places. <br>
                            Freight trains are usually as long as the country's laws allow. In the United States, you
                            can find freight trains of up to 4km long!

                        <p>After a few years of ferrying freight, engineers realised that the train could be an
                            innovative solution for travel. <br>
                            Passenger trains can either be made up of dedicated powered passenger cars, or dedicated
                            unpowered passenger cars pulled by a locomotive. <br>
                            Passenger cars tend to be sleeker and cleaner than freight cars because of the fact that
                            people care about cleanliness standards, unlike cargo.
                            These trains may also differ in design dependiong on operating conditions such as speed and service intensity.

                                    <p>The oldest of the power sources, steam powered trains use compressed steam to
                                        drive pistons that produce rotational motion, that is then sent to the wheels.
                                        The trains are equipped with a boiler filled with water, which is heated using
                                        an onboard fire to produce the steam.<br>
                                        Steam power was most used pre - World War 2 when engine technology wasn't
                                        developed enough to handle the loads required to pull large trains. As
                                        technology evolved in the 1950s, trains gradually began to switch to diesel
                                        engined propulsion due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

                                            <p>There are several methods in which electric trains collect power from the
                                                grid. <br>
                                                The first is the use of a "3rd rail", an electrified metal rail that
                                                carries an electric charge that the train picks up using a so-called
                                                "shoe." This system is used mostly on metros, such as (most of) the <a

                                                The second method is the use of an overhead wire. Similar to the third
                                                rail, an electric charge flows through the wire and the train picks it
                                                up using a "catenary" that is constantly in contact with the wire. This

                    <h2>Configuration</h2>
                    <p>There are 2 main types of train configurations: multiple unit and locomotive hauled trains.<br>
                        In a locomotive hauled train, all traction-related equipment (basically anything that allows the train to move) is concentrated into 1 single carriage of the train. <br>
                        The driver sits in this carriage and controls the whole train from it. <br>
                        The rest of the train contains no means for the driver to control it, besides the brakes.<br>
                        This arragement is generally more flexible to run as the company can pick and choose where each individual train car and locomotive can go.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <p>In a multiple-unit type train has the same power and traction equipment as a locomotive hauled train, but instead of having all of the traction equipment in 1 carriage, it is spread all throughout the carriages of the train.<br>
                    The carriages of these trains are often semi-permanently coupled together as these carraiges many only propel themselves when coupled together. <br>
                    Not all all carriages of a multiple unit train need to have motors. Some may carry auxiliary equipment such as air compressors and batterys etc. <br>
                    Virtually all rapid transit lines use multiple-unit trains, including the Singapore MRT and LRT.

                            This railway used human and animal power, and the cars were pulled along with a rope.<br>
                            This is one of the earliest descriptions of any form of rail transport in history.<br>

                        <p>In the 1700s, there was an uptick in iron production in Britain because of the introduction to steam-powered blast furnaces. <br>
                            As a result, the Coalbrookdale company was able to fix plates of cast iron onto the wooden rails of their railway. This significantly improved the carrying capacity of their railway and improved productivity.<br>
                            This started an era of iron-tracked railways all over Europe. <br>
                            The discovery of the Bessemer process enabled steel to be made inexpensively. This led to the great expansion of the railways.

It used high pressure steam to drive the train forward using a series of gears connected to the wheels. Despite revolutionising the railways, the locomotive itself never made it beyond the experimental stage.</p>

                            Some notable railway lines built include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_Main_Line" target="_blank">East Coast Main Line</a> in the UK, which was completed in the 1840s which connects the cities of London and Edinburgh across 393 miles (632km) of track,<br>
                            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_railroad" target="_blank">Overland Route</a> in the US, which was completed in the 1860s and connects the cities of San Francisco and Omaha across 1,911 miles  (3,075km) of track, <br>
                            and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line" target="_blank">Tokaido Main Line</a> in Japan, which was completed in the 1890s and connects the cities of Tokyo and Kobe across 589.5km (366.3 miles) of line.<br>
                            These lines later became the backbones of their respective national networks.<br>
                            The point is that the mid to late 1800s were the start of a "golden age" of rail travel, as can be seen by the meteoric growth of rail lines all over the world.<br>
                            This was not limited to intercity railways, either. Some of the world's most famous city subway systems began popping up during this period too. Examples include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway" target="_blank">New York City Subway</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground" target="_blank">The London Underground.</a>

                        <p> The 1920s and 1940s was when rail travel was arguably at its peak.<br>
                            Service across the world was at an all time high, and the train was the preferred method of transport for all, regardless of financial status. <br>
                            This era also saw huge leaps in technology, with the invention of high-pressure steam boilers which allowed the steam trains of the time to travel at great speeds, with the UK's A4 class locomotive, named "Mallard", hitting a breakneck speed of 126 miles per hour (206km/h) in 1938, a record that it holds to this day.<br>
                            The German Railways had attempted several to out-speed the British, with trains such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRG_Class_SVT_877" target="_blank">Flying Hamburger.</a><br>
                            This marked the end of a several year long competition with the Germans, who had shifted their priorities from out-doing the English in railway tecnology to invading the whole of Eastern Europe, kickstarting World War Two.

                            The Second World War put an abrubt stop to the monumental advances in railway technology. Despite this, the war had many impacts on the future of rail travel.<br>
                            Most of the railway infrastructure in countries affected by the war was destroyed by aerial bombardment. This set back any technological progress made over the years. <br>

                        <p>Following the end of the war, many of the world's railways were in shambles. However, this gave the governments of their countries a chance to start anew. <br>
                        This, however, was not the path that most of them took. Instead of re-building the railways, most governments opted instead to expand their road networks.<br> 
                        In addition to this, the advent of the jet airliner encouraged governments to invest in airlines instead of the railways. <br>
                        This siphoned most of the railway traffic away to the roads and the skies.

                        <p>Things changed again, this time thanks to the Japanese.<br>
                        On the 1st of October 1964, the first ever <i>Shinkansen</i> (bullet train) service ran from Tokyo to Osaka. It covered the 515km journey in four hours, down from the 6hour 40minute journey that conventional trains took. <br>
                        This was a massive improvement in journey time. However, that wasn't all. By the next year, the journey only took 3 hours 10 minutes, owing to an increase in track speed limits.<br>
                        The world went into a frenzy after seeing what the Shinkansen had achieved. In the following decades, countries from all over the world began to develop their own form of high speed rail.<br>
                        This resulted in the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity_Express" target="_blank">Intercity Express</a> and the French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV" target="_blank">TGV</a>, as well as the railways that rely on technology developed by these 2 railways.<br>
                        This brings us to today. Rail travel is growing, with increasing passenger numbers year on year. As technology evolves, trains will go further, faster. Magnetic levitation (Maglev) Trains that can go over 500 km/h are already in their testing phase, and the first maglev line is slated for completion in 2027. <br>
                        Suitably enough, the line is being built in Japan, the very same country that built the innovative shinkansen all those years ago. The very same country that helped make rail rise again.
